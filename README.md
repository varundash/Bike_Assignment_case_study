## General Information
- **Background**: This project is focused on predicting the demand for shared bikes in the US market post-COVID-19, using historical data from BoomBikes. The goal is to identify significant factors affecting bike demand and help the company strategize for revenue growth.
- **Business Problem**: BoomBikes faced a dip in revenues during the pandemic and aims to optimize its business plan by understanding demand dynamics.
- **Dataset**: A dataset containing daily bike rental data, including weather, seasonal, and user-related factors.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.8+
- Pandas 1.x
- NumPy 1.x
- Matplotlib 3.x
- Seaborn 0.x
- scikit-learn 1.x

## Conclusions
1. **Significant Variables**: Several features such as temperature, season, and user type strongly influence bike demand.
2. **Model Performance**: The developed regression model achieved an R-squared score of 0.81 on the test set, indicating that the model explains 81% of the variance in the total bike rentals. This demonstrates a strong fit, suggesting the model captures the relationship between the predictors and the target variable effectively.
3. **Business Insights**: Demand increases during specific seasons and weather conditions, providing actionable insights for BoomBikes' inventory and marketing strategies.
4. **Future Scope**: Further analysis with additional data (e.g., time of day, user demographics) can enhance predictions.
